Deleted many old unnecessary files from repository. Also removed some old Flex graphics files from the build process.


I made some small adjustments of GUI elements.

For example, the "Send Profile" area has been revised. The text field has been enlarged, "Low", "High" arranged accordingly.
The views of the different modulation types have been adjusted so that they are now congruent and no difference/offset can be seen when switching from SSB to DSB/AM/SAM/SPEC.

The Split/VFO A>B etc. buttons have also been aligned.
